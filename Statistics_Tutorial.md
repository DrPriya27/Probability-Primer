# Introduction to Statistics - I

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will be able to:
- Define statistics and explain its importance in scientific inquiry
- Distinguish between descriptive and inferential statistics
- Identify key terminology in statistical analysis
- Explain the difference between population and sample
- Recognize the role of statistics in various professional fields

## What is Statistics?

**Definition:** Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data.

Statistics provides methods for making sense of data in the face of uncertainty and variability. It's an essential tool in research across disciplines, from social sciences to natural sciences, business, medicine, and engineering.

### Detailed Example: COVID-19 Data Analysis

Consider how statistics was crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic:

1. **Data Collection**: Health agencies gathered data on:
   - Number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths
   - Demographics of affected individuals
   - Geographic distribution of outbreaks
   - Vaccination rates and effectiveness

2. **Data Analysis**: Statisticians applied various methods:
   - Calculated daily case rates and mortality percentages
   - Identified high-risk populations using regression analysis
   - Estimated reproduction numbers (R₀) to measure virus spread
   - Analyzed vaccine efficacy through controlled trials

3. **Interpretation**: Findings were interpreted considering:
   - Testing limitations and reporting delays
   - Demographic variations in different regions
   - Changes in virus variants over time
   - Confidence intervals around estimates

4. **Presentation**: Results were communicated through:
   - Daily dashboards with case counts and trends
   - Charts showing hospitalization rates over time
   - Maps displaying geographic hotspots
   - Projections of future trends based on statistical models

This example demonstrates how statistics transforms raw data (individual case reports) into actionable insights that guided public health decisions, resource allocation, and policy development during a global crisis.

### Historical Context

Statistics has evolved from simple governmental data collection (census, taxation) to a sophisticated field that drives decision-making in virtually every discipline:

- **17th Century**: Early probability theory development (Pascal, Fermat)
- **18th Century**: Bayesian statistics emerges
- **19th Century**: Normal distribution and regression analysis (Gauss, Galton)
- **20th Century**: Modern statistical methods, hypothesis testing (Fisher, Pearson)
- **21st Century**: Big data analytics, computational statistics, machine learning integration

## Types of Statistics

### 1. Descriptive Statistics
**Purpose**: To summarize and organize data in a meaningful way

**Methods include**:
- Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
- Measures of dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation)
- Data visualization (graphs, charts)
- Frequency distributions

#### Detailed Example: Student Exam Performance

Consider a professor analyzing final exam scores for a class of 30 students:

**Raw data (scores out of 100)**: 
```
78, 85, 92, 67, 73, 88, 90, 76, 85, 79, 
94, 68, 87, 81, 79, 85, 91, 66, 78, 82, 
89, 94, 77, 84, 71, 76, 88, 85, 92, 81
```

**Descriptive Statistics Analysis**:

1. **Measures of Central Tendency**:
   - Mean (average) = 82.3
   - Median (middle value when ordered) = 83
   - Mode (most frequent value) = 85

2. **Measures of Dispersion**:
   - Range = 94 - 66 = 28
   - Variance = 58.7
   - Standard Deviation = 7.66

3. **Frequency Distribution**:
   | Score Range | Frequency | Percentage |
   |-------------|-----------|------------|
   | 60-69       | 2         | 6.7%       |
   | 70-79       | 9         | 30.0%      |
   | 80-89       | 13        | 43.3%      |
   | 90-99       | 6         | 20.0%      |

4. **Visual Representation**:
   - Histogram showing the distribution of scores
   - Box plot showing median, quartiles, and any outliers

5. **Interpretation**:
   - Most students (63.3%) scored between 80-99
   - The distribution is slightly negatively skewed (mean < median)
   - No extreme outliers are present
   - The class performed well overall with minimal failing grades

This example demonstrates how descriptive statistics transforms raw scores into meaningful insights about class performance, helping the professor evaluate teaching effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.

### 2. Inferential Statistics
**Purpose**: To make predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample

**Methods include**:
- Hypothesis testing
- Confidence intervals
- Regression analysis
- Analysis of variance (ANOVA)

#### Detailed Example: New Drug Effectiveness

A pharmaceutical company wants to determine if a new drug reduces cholesterol levels. They cannot test every potential patient (the population), so they conduct a clinical trial with a sample:

**Study Design**:
- Sample: 200 randomly selected patients with high cholesterol
- Treatment: 100 patients receive the new drug, 100 receive a placebo
- Measurement: Cholesterol reduction after 30 days (in mg/dL)

**Sample Results**:
- Drug group: Mean reduction = 18.7 mg/dL, SD = 5.2 mg/dL
- Placebo group: Mean reduction = 3.2 mg/dL, SD = 4.8 mg/dL

**Inferential Statistics Analysis**:

1. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - H₀: The drug has no effect (μ₁ = μ₂)
   - H₁: The drug reduces cholesterol (μ₁ > μ₂)
   - Two-sample t-test: t = 21.4, p < 0.001
   - Decision: Reject H₀ since p < 0.05

2. **Confidence Interval**:
   - 95% CI for mean difference: (14.1, 16.9) mg/dL
   - Interpretation: We're 95% confident the true average reduction difference between drug and placebo is between 14.1 and 16.9 mg/dL

3. **Effect Size**:
   - Cohen's d = 3.03 (very large effect)

4. **Inference to Population**:
   - Based on this sample, the company can infer that the drug will be effective for the broader population of patients with high cholesterol
   - The small p-value suggests it's very unlikely these results occurred by chance
   - The confidence interval provides a range for the expected cholesterol reduction in the general patient population

This example demonstrates how inferential statistics allows researchers to draw conclusions about an entire population (all potential patients) based on data from just a small sample (200 trial participants), with quantified reliability in the form of p-values and confidence intervals.

## Key Statistical Concepts

### Population vs. Sample
- **Population**: The entire group of individuals or instances about which information is sought
- **Sample**: A subset of the population selected for study

![Population vs Sample](https://i.imgur.com/ZKDRx12.png)

#### Detailed Example: Student Satisfaction Survey

**Research Question**: What is the average satisfaction level of students with university facilities?

**Population vs. Sample Definition**:
- **Population**: All 25,000 students enrolled at the university
- **Sample**: 500 randomly selected students who complete the survey

**Practical Implementation**:

1. **Population Parameters** (what we want to know but can't measure directly):
   - μ: True mean satisfaction score of all 25,000 students
   - σ: True standard deviation of satisfaction scores

2. **Sample Statistics** (what we actually measure):
   - x̄: Mean satisfaction score from 500 surveyed students = 7.8/10
   - s: Standard deviation of sample scores = 1.5

3. **Sampling Process**:
   - Generate list of all 25,000 students (sampling frame)
   - Use random number generator to select 500 students
   - Send surveys and collect responses
   - Calculate statistics from respondents

4. **Inference**:
   - 95% confidence interval: 7.8 ± 0.13 = (7.67, 7.93)
   - Interpretation: "We are 95% confident that the true average satisfaction score for all university students is between 7.67 and 7.93 out of 10."

5. **Sampling Challenges**:
   - **Non-response bias**: Perhaps less satisfied students didn't complete the survey
   - **Coverage error**: If the student list was incomplete or outdated
   - **Sampling error**: Natural variation between different potential samples

This example illustrates the fundamental relationship between populations and samples. The university administrators want to know about all 25,000 students (population) but can only feasibly collect data from 500 (sample). Statistical methods allow them to make reasonably accurate estimates about the population based on the sample, with quantifiable margins of error (confidence intervals).

### Variables and Data Types
- **Variable**: A characteristic that can be measured and can vary across individuals or objects
- **Types of Variables**:
  - **Qualitative** (categorical): Non-numeric characteristics (gender, color, type)
  - **Quantitative** (numerical): Numeric measurements
    - **Discrete**: Countable values (number of students)
    - **Continuous**: Infinite possible values within a range (height, temperature)

### Parameters vs. Statistics
- **Parameter**: A numerical value that describes a characteristic of a population (usually unknown)
- **Statistic**: A numerical value that describes a characteristic of a sample (used to estimate parameters)

| Population (Parameter) | Sample (Statistic) |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Mean (μ)              | Mean (x̄)         |
| Standard Deviation (σ) | Standard Deviation (s) |
| Proportion (P)        | Proportion (p)    |

## The Statistical Process

1. **Formulating the Question**: Define the research problem
2. **Designing the Study**: Determine data collection methods
3. **Data Collection**: Gather data through appropriate methods
4. **Data Analysis**: Apply statistical techniques to analyze data
5. **Interpretation**: Draw conclusions from the analysis
6. **Communication**: Present findings effectively

## Applications of Statistics

Statistics plays a crucial role in:
- **Medicine**: Clinical trials, epidemiology
- **Economics**: Market trends, economic forecasting
- **Psychology**: Behavioral studies, experimental design
- **Engineering**: Quality control, reliability analysis
- **Business**: Market research, financial analysis
- **Social Sciences**: Population studies, survey analysis
- **Sports Analytics**: Player performance, strategy development

# Introduction to Statistics - II

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will be able to:
- Understand the principles of statistical inference
- Explain the process of hypothesis testing
- Calculate and interpret confidence intervals
- Distinguish between statistical and practical significance
- Identify appropriate statistical tests for different scenarios

## Statistical Inference

**Definition**: The process of drawing conclusions about a population based on a sample.

Statistical inference is necessary because:
- Studying entire populations is often impractical or impossible
- Well-designed samples can provide reliable information about populations
- Properly quantified uncertainty helps in making informed decisions

### The Role of Probability in Inference

Probability theory provides the mathematical foundation for statistical inference:
- It helps quantify uncertainty in our estimates
- It allows us to make statements about the reliability of our conclusions
- It guides the development of statistical methods

**Key Probability Concepts for Inference**:
- **Random Variables**: Variables whose values depend on random events
- **Probability Distributions**: Mathematical functions describing the likelihood of outcomes
  - **Normal Distribution**: Bell-shaped curve critical for many statistical methods
  - **t-Distribution**: Used when sample sizes are small or population variance is unknown
  - **Chi-Square Distribution**: Used for categorical data analysis
  - **F-Distribution**: Used for comparing variances

![Common Probability Distributions](https://i.imgur.com/kGMKWxy.png)

## Hypothesis Testing

**Definition**: A formal procedure for testing a claim about a population parameter using sample data.

### The Hypothesis Testing Process

1. **State the Hypotheses**:
   - **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: Statement of no effect or no difference (status quo)
   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or H_a)**: Statement of effect or difference (research hypothesis)

2. **Set the Significance Level (α)**:
   - Typically 0.05 (5%), 0.01 (1%), or 0.10 (10%)
   - Represents the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis

3. **Select the Test Statistic**:
   - Formula that converts sample data into a single value for decision-making
   - Common test statistics: Z-score, t-statistic, F-statistic, Chi-square

4. **Calculate the Test Statistic and p-value**:
   - **p-value**: Probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the observed value, assuming the null hypothesis is true
   
5. **Make a Decision**:
   - If p-value ≤ α: Reject H₀
   - If p-value > α: Fail to reject H₀

6. **State the Conclusion in Context**:
   - Interpret the result in terms of the original research question

#### Detailed Example: Testing a New Teaching Method

A college professor develops a new teaching method and wants to determine if it improves student performance compared to the traditional method.

**Research Question**: Does the new teaching method improve student test scores?

**Step 1: State the Hypotheses**
- H₀: μ₁ - μ₂ = 0 (The new method has no effect on average test scores)
- H₁: μ₁ - μ₂ > 0 (The new method increases average test scores)

Where:
- μ₁ = mean test score with new method
- μ₂ = mean test score with traditional method

**Step 2: Set the Significance Level**
- α = 0.05 (standard in educational research)

**Step 3: Collect and Summarize Data**
- Two sections of the same course, randomly assigned:
  - Group 1 (new method): n₁ = 35 students, x̄₁ = 84.2, s₁ = 8.5
  - Group 2 (traditional): n₂ = 38 students, x̄₂ = 79.6, s₂ = 9.1

**Step 4: Select the Test**
- Independent samples t-test (two-sample t-test)
- Appropriate because:
  - Comparing means of two independent groups
  - Sample sizes are moderate
  - We don't know population standard deviations

**Step 5: Calculate the Test Statistic**
- t = (x̄₁ - x̄₂) / √[(s₁²/n₁) + (s₂²/n₂)]
- t = (84.2 - 79.6) / √[(8.5²/35) + (9.1²/38)]
- t = 4.6 / 2.09
- t = 2.20

**Step 6: Find the p-value**
- For a one-tailed test with df = 71 (approximate), t = 2.20
- p-value = 0.0155

**Step 7: Make a Decision**
- Since p-value (0.0155) < α (0.05), we reject H₀

**Step 8: State the Conclusion**
- "There is statistically significant evidence (t(71) = 2.20, p = 0.0155) that the new teaching method increases student test scores. The new method resulted in an average score 4.6 points higher than the traditional method."

**Step 9: Additional Context**
- Effect size (Cohen's d) = 0.52 (medium effect)
- 95% confidence interval for the difference: (0.46, 8.74)
- Practical significance: A 4.6-point improvement may be meaningful in educational contexts, potentially raising student letter grades

This example walks through the complete hypothesis testing process, from formulating the research question to interpreting the results in context, demonstrating how statistical methods help educators make evidence-based decisions about teaching practices.

### Types of Errors in Hypothesis Testing

| | H₀ is Actually True | H₀ is Actually False |
|---------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Decision: Reject H₀**   | Type I Error<br>(False Positive)<br>Probability = α | Correct Decision<br>(Power)<br>Probability = 1-β |
| **Decision: Fail to Reject H₀** | Correct Decision<br>Probability = 1-α | Type II Error<br>(False Negative)<br>Probability = β |

- **Type I Error**: Rejecting a true null hypothesis (false positive)
- **Type II Error**: Failing to reject a false null hypothesis (false negative)

## Confidence Intervals

**Definition**: A range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a specified level of confidence.

### Interpreting a Confidence Interval

A 95% confidence interval means: If we were to take many samples and construct confidence intervals for each sample, about 95% of those intervals would contain the true population parameter.

**Formula for Confidence Interval for a Mean**:
x̄ ± (critical value × standard error)

Where:
- x̄ is the sample mean
- Standard error = s/√n (s is sample standard deviation, n is sample size)
- Critical value depends on confidence level and distribution:
  - For large samples (n≥30): Z-score (from normal distribution)
  - For small samples (n<30): t-score (from t-distribution)

**Common Confidence Levels**:
- 90% confidence: Z = 1.645 or t-value with appropriate df
- 95% confidence: Z = 1.96 or t-value with appropriate df
- 99% confidence: Z = 2.576 or t-value with appropriate df

#### Detailed Example: Blood Pressure Medication Study

A medical researcher is studying the effectiveness of a new blood pressure medication. She wants to estimate the average reduction in systolic blood pressure (in mmHg) for patients taking this medication.

**Research Question**: What is the average reduction in systolic blood pressure for patients taking the new medication?

**Study Data**:
- Sample size (n): 45 patients
- Sample mean reduction (x̄): 12.8 mmHg
- Sample standard deviation (s): 4.5 mmHg

**Calculating a 95% Confidence Interval**:

1. **Identify the critical value**:
   - Large sample (n > 30), so use Z-score
   - 95% confidence level: Z = 1.96

2. **Calculate the standard error**:
   - SE = s/√n = 4.5/√45 = 4.5/6.71 = 0.67

3. **Calculate the margin of error**:
   - ME = Z × SE = 1.96 × 0.67 = 1.31

4. **Calculate the confidence interval**:
   - x̄ ± ME = 12.8 ± 1.31 = (11.49, 14.11)
   
5. **Round appropriately**:
   - 95% CI = (11.5, 14.1) mmHg

**Interpretation**:

"Based on our sample data, we are 95% confident that the true average reduction in systolic blood pressure for all patients taking this medication is between 11.5 and 14.1 mmHg."

**Clinical Application**:
- The entire confidence interval shows values greater than 10 mmHg, which is the threshold considered clinically significant
- Even at the lower end of the interval (11.5 mmHg), the medication appears effective
- Doctors can be reasonably confident recommending this medication, knowing that the true effect is unlikely to be below 11.5 mmHg

**What If We Used Different Confidence Levels?**
- 90% confidence interval: 12.8 ± (1.645 × 0.67) = (11.7, 13.9) mmHg
  - Narrower interval but less confidence
- 99% confidence interval: 12.8 ± (2.576 × 0.67) = (11.1, 14.5) mmHg
  - Wider interval but more confidence

This example demonstrates how confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for the population parameter, quantify the precision of our estimate, and support evidence-based medical decisions with a known level of statistical confidence.

### Relationship Between Confidence Level and Interval Width

- Higher confidence level → wider interval → less precise
- Lower confidence level → narrower interval → more precise but less reliable

### Factors Affecting Confidence Interval Width

1. **Sample Size (n)**: Larger samples produce narrower intervals
2. **Variability (s)**: Greater variability produces wider intervals
3. **Confidence Level**: Higher confidence levels produce wider intervals

## Statistical Significance vs. Practical Significance

**Statistical Significance**: When results are unlikely to have occurred by chance (p-value ≤ α)

**Practical Significance**: When results have meaningful real-world implications

Important distinctions:
- Statistical significance doesn't guarantee practical importance
- With very large samples, tiny, meaningless differences can be statistically significant
- Effect size measures help assess practical significance

**Common Effect Size Measures**:
- **Cohen's d**: Standardized mean difference
- **Correlation coefficient (r)**: Strength of relationship
- **Odds ratio**: Relative odds of an outcome

## Common Statistical Tests

| Test | Purpose | Data Type | Example |
|------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Z-test | Compare sample mean to known population mean | Quantitative | Is the average exam score different from 70? |
| One-sample t-test | Compare sample mean to hypothesized value when σ unknown | Quantitative | Is the average weight loss after diet different from 0? |
| Two-sample t-test | Compare means of two independent groups | Quantitative | Do men and women differ in average salary? |
| Paired t-test | Compare means of matched pairs | Quantitative | Does blood pressure differ before and after treatment? |
| ANOVA | Compare means of three or more groups | Quantitative | Do three teaching methods differ in effectiveness? |
| Chi-square test | Examine relationship between categorical variables | Categorical | Is political affiliation related to stance on climate change? |
| Correlation | Measure strength of relationship | Quantitative | Is height related to weight? |
| Linear regression | Predict one variable from another | Quantitative | Can we predict sales from advertising expenditure? |

  - Natural experiments
  - Quasi-experiments

### 3. Observational Studies
- **Features**: No manipulation, observing naturally occurring events
- **Advantages**: Real-world context, study phenomena that cannot be manipulated
- **Disadvantages**: Cannot establish causality, potential for observer bias
- **Types**:
  - Cross-sectional studies
  - Case-control studies
  - Cohort studies
  - Longitudinal studies

### 4. Administrative Data
- **Features**: Data collected for non-research purposes (e.g., government records)
- **Advantages**: Large datasets, no additional collection costs
- **Disadvantages**: Limited control over data quality, may not include all variables of interest

### 5. Secondary Data Analysis
- **Features**: Using existing datasets collected by others
- **Advantages**: Cost-effective, time-saving
- **Disadvantages**: Data may not perfectly match research questions, quality concerns

## Sampling Techniques

### Probability Sampling
Methods where each element has a known, non-zero probability of selection

1. **Simple Random Sampling**:
   - Every element has an equal chance of selection
   - Example method: Random number generator, lottery system
   - Advantages: Easy to understand, representative of population
   - Disadvantages: Requires complete sampling frame, may not capture important subgroups

   #### Detailed Example: Customer Satisfaction Survey

   A retail store wants to survey customers about their shopping experience.
   
   **Population**: All 15,000 customers in the store's database
   
   **Simple Random Sampling Process**:
   1. Assign each customer a number from 1 to 15,000
   2. Use a random number generator to select 500 numbers between 1 and 15,000
   3. Survey the 500 customers corresponding to the selected numbers
   
   **Implementation**:
   ```
   # Using R programming language
   set.seed(42)  # For reproducibility
   population_size <- 15000
   sample_size <- 500
   selected_customers <- sample(1:population_size, sample_size, replace=FALSE)
   ```
   
   **Result**: Each customer has exactly 1/30 (3.33%) probability of being selected, creating an unbiased representation of the customer base.

2. **Stratified Random Sampling**:
   - Population divided into non-overlapping strata; samples drawn from each stratum
   - Example: Sampling students from each grade level
   - Advantages: Ensures representation of key subgroups, can reduce variance
   - Disadvantages: Requires knowledge of stratifying variables, more complex

   #### Detailed Example: University Student Survey

   A university researcher wants to study student opinions about campus facilities, ensuring representation across all years of study.
   
   **Population**: 20,000 university students
   
   **Stratification Variable**: Year of study (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)
   
   **Population Breakdown**:
   - 1st year: 6,000 students (30%)
   - 2nd year: 5,500 students (27.5%)
   - 3rd year: 4,500 students (22.5%)
   - 4th year: 4,000 students (20%)
   
   **Stratified Sampling Process** (for a sample of 800):
   1. Calculate proportional allocation for each stratum:
      - 1st year: 800 × 0.30 = 240 students
      - 2nd year: 800 × 0.275 = 220 students
      - 3rd year: 800 × 0.225 = 180 students
      - 4th year: 800 × 0.20 = 160 students
   2. Perform simple random sampling within each stratum
   
   **Advantage Demonstrated**: If 4th-year students have significantly different opinions (perhaps due to more experience with facilities), this method ensures their perspective is proportionally represented, unlike simple random sampling which might by chance include too few or too many 4th-year students.

3. **Cluster Sampling**:
   - Population divided into clusters; entire clusters randomly selected
   - Example: Randomly selecting schools, then including all students
   - Advantages: Practical when complete list unavailable, reduces costs
   - Disadvantages: Less precise, requires larger sample for same precision

   #### Detailed Example: National Health Survey

   Health researchers need to conduct physical measurements that require in-person visits, making it impractical to visit randomly selected individuals across the entire country.
   
   **Population**: All residents in a country with 50 million people
   
   **Cluster Sampling Process**:
   1. Divide the country into 3,000 geographic areas (clusters)
   2. Randomly select 100 of these areas
   3. Include all households (or a sample of households) from each selected area
   
   **Practical Implementation**:
   - Researchers only need to travel to 100 locations instead of potentially thousands
   - Field teams can be efficiently deployed to these areas
   - Cost of data collection is drastically reduced
   
   **Limitation Example**: If all selected clusters happen to be in urban areas, the sample might underrepresent rural populations. This is why cluster sampling often requires larger overall sample sizes to achieve the same precision as simple random sampling.

4. **Systematic Sampling**:
   - Select elements at regular intervals after random start
   - Example: Selecting every 10th person from a list
   - Advantages: Simple to implement, spreads sample throughout population
   - Disadvantages: Potential periodicity issues if list has patterns

   #### Detailed Example: Factory Quality Control

   A factory producing light bulbs wants to implement quality control testing without disrupting the production process too much.
   
   **Population**: 10,000 light bulbs produced daily
   
   **Systematic Sampling Process**:
   1. Determine sampling interval: k = N/n = 10,000/100 = 100
      (To test 100 bulbs, select every 100th bulb)
   2. Choose a random starting point between 1 and k (e.g., 37)
   3. Select bulbs at positions: 37, 137, 237, 337, ..., 9937
   
   **Practical Application**:
   - Quality control inspectors can easily identify which bulbs to test
   - The sample is spread throughout the day's production
   - No need to generate and track random numbers for each selection
   
   **Potential Issue**: If there's a machine that causes defects every 100th bulb (coinciding exactly with the sampling interval), the quality issues might be either completely missed or drastically overrepresented in the sample.

### Non-Probability Sampling
Methods where selection probabilities are unknown

1. **Convenience Sampling**:
   - Selecting readily available units
   - Example: Surveying people at a shopping mall
   - Advantages: Quick, inexpensive
   - Disadvantages: High risk of bias, not representative

2. **Purposive/Judgmental Sampling**:
   - Selecting based on researcher's judgment about typicality
   - Example: Selecting "typical" classrooms for observation
   - Advantages: Can focus on cases of interest, useful for qualitative research
   - Disadvantages: Subjective, potential researcher bias

3. **Quota Sampling**:
   - Setting quotas for subgroup characteristics
   - Example: Ensuring sample has same age distribution as population
   - Advantages: Ensures representation of key characteristics
   - Disadvantages: Selection within quotas is non-random

4. **Snowball Sampling**:
   - Initial participants recruit additional participants
   - Example: Studying hard-to-reach populations (e.g., drug users)
   - Advantages: Can reach hidden populations
   - Disadvantages: Strong selection bias

### Sample Size Determination

Factors affecting sample size:
- Desired confidence level
- Margin of error/precision
- Population variability
- Population size (for small populations)

**Basic Formula for Sample Size (Proportion)**:
n = Z²·p·(1-p)/E²

Where:
- n is sample size
- Z is Z-score for desired confidence level
- p is estimated proportion (0.5 if unknown)
- E is margin of error

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

### Steps in Data Cleaning

1. **Import and Initial Review**:
   - Load data into analysis software
   - Check variable types and formats
   - Review first and last few records
   - Generate summary statistics

2. **Handle Missing Data**:
   - Identify missing values
   - Determine if missing at random or systematic
   - Strategies:
     - Delete cases (if few)
     - Imputation (mean, median, regression, multiple imputation)
     - Create missing data indicator
     - Use methods robust to missing data

3. **Identify and Handle Outliers**:
   - Detect using visualization and statistical methods:
     - Z-scores (typically |Z| > 3)
     - Tukey's method (1.5 × IQR rule)
     - Cook's distance (for regression)
   - Strategies:
     - Verify if outlier is valid or error
     - Retain with robust methods
     - Winsorize (cap at percentile)
     - Transform data
     - Remove (with strong justification)

4. **Data Transformation**:
   - Purpose: Normalize distributions, linearize relationships, stabilize variance
   - Common transformations:
     - Logarithmic (for right-skewed data)
     - Square root (for count data)
     - Box-Cox (family of power transformations)
     - Standardization (Z-scores)
     - Min-max scaling

5. **Creating New Variables**:
   - Recoding (collapsing categories)
   - Computing composite scores
   - Interaction terms
   - Dummy variables for categorical data

## Measures of Central Tendency

### 1. Mean (Arithmetic Average)
**Definition**: Sum of all values divided by number of values.

**Formula**: x̄ = (∑x)/n

**Properties**:
- Influenced by extreme values (not robust to outliers)
- Takes all values into account
- Algebraically tractable
- Best measure for normally distributed data

**When to use**: Interval/ratio data with symmetric distribution

#### Detailed Example: Monthly Expenses

A student tracks their monthly expenses (in dollars) for the past 6 months:
```
$850, $875, $890, $910, $1,200, $865
```

**Calculating the Mean**:
1. Sum all values: $850 + $875 + $890 + $910 + $1,200 + $865 = $5,590
2. Divide by number of values: $5,590 ÷ 6 = $931.67

**Interpretation**:
- The average monthly expense is $931.67
- Note how the unusually high month ($1,200) pulls the mean upward
- If planning a budget based on this mean, the student might overestimate their typical expenses

### 2. Median
**Definition**: Middle value when data is arranged in order.

**Finding the median**:
- If n is odd: Middle value
- If n is even: Average of two middle values

**Properties**:
- Not influenced by extreme values (robust to outliers)
- Based only on position, not actual values
- Best measure for skewed distributions

**When to use**: Ordinal data or interval/ratio data with skewed distribution

#### Detailed Example: Monthly Expenses (continued)

Using the same expense data: $850, $875, $890, $910, $1,200, $865

**Calculating the Median**:
1. Arrange values in order: $850, $865, $875, $890, $910, $1,200
2. Find the middle position: With 6 values (even), take average of 3rd and 4th values
3. Median = ($875 + $890) ÷ 2 = $882.50

**Interpretation**:
- The median monthly expense is $882.50
- This is lower than the mean ($931.67) because the median isn't influenced by the outlier month
- The median better represents the student's typical monthly expenses
- For budgeting purposes, the median might provide a more realistic baseline

### 3. Mode
**Definition**: Most frequently occurring value.

**Properties**:
- Multiple modes possible (bimodal, multimodal)
- Only measure of central tendency for nominal data
- May not exist or be unique
- Useful for categorical data

**When to use**: Any data type, especially nominal

#### Detailed Example: Course Enrollment

A college offers multiple sections of a popular course. The number of students enrolled in each section is:
```
32, 28, 35, 28, 30, 28, 34, 35, 25
```

**Finding the Mode**:
1. Count the frequency of each value:
   - 25: occurs 1 time
   - 28: occurs 3 times
   - 30: occurs 1 time
   - 32: occurs 1 time
   - 34: occurs 1 time
   - 35: occurs 2 times
2. The most frequent value is 28, which occurs 3 times

**Interpretation**:
- The mode of class size is 28 students
- This could be useful for classroom allocation planning
- If most sections have 28 students, classrooms that comfortably fit 28-30 students would be appropriate

#### Another Example: Categorical Data (T-shirt Sizes)

A campus store sells T-shirts and tracks sales by size:
```
S: 45 shirts
M: 80 shirts
L: 120 shirts
XL: 65 shirts
XXL: 40 shirts
```

**Finding the Mode**:
1. The most frequently occurring value is L (120 shirts)

**Interpretation**:
- The modal size is L
- This is useful for inventory planning - order more L sizes
- Mean and median aren't applicable here since the sizes are categorical (ordinal)

### 4. Other Measures
- **Geometric Mean**: nth root of the product of n values
  - Used for growth rates, returns, ratios
  - Formula: (x₁·x₂·...·xₙ)^(1/n)

- **Harmonic Mean**: Reciprocal of the average of reciprocals
  - Used for rates and ratios
  - Formula: n/(∑(1/x))

- **Weighted Mean**: Sum of values times weights divided by sum of weights
  - Used when some observations are more important than others
  - Formula: (∑wx)/(∑w)

## Measures of Dispersion

### 1. Range
**Definition**: Difference between maximum and minimum values.

**Formula**: Range = Maximum - Minimum

**Properties**:
- Simple to calculate and understand
- Very sensitive to outliers
- Provides limited information about distribution

### 2. Interquartile Range (IQR)
**Definition**: Difference between third quartile (Q3) and first quartile (Q1).

**Formula**: IQR = Q3 - Q1

**Properties**:
- Robust to outliers
- Describes middle 50% of data
- Used in boxplots
- Basis for outlier detection

### 3. Variance
**Definition**: Average of squared deviations from the mean.

**Formulas**:
- Population: σ² = ∑(x-μ)²/N
- Sample: s² = ∑(x-x̄)²/(n-1)

**Properties**:
- Sensitive to outliers
- Units are squared (harder to interpret)
- Mathematically useful for further analysis

### 4. Standard Deviation
**Definition**: Square root of variance.

**Formulas**:
- Population: σ = √(σ²)
- Sample: s = √(s²)

**Properties**:
- Same units as original data
- Widely used in statistical analysis
- Basis for many statistical procedures
- For normal distribution:
  - Approximately 68% of data within 1 SD of mean
  - Approximately 95% within 2 SD
  - Approximately 99.7% within 3 SD

### 5. Coefficient of Variation
**Definition**: Standard deviation divided by mean, often expressed as percentage.

**Formula**: CV = (s/x̄) × 100%

**Properties**:
- Unitless measure of relative variability
- Allows comparison of variability across datasets with different units
- Useful when mean values differ substantially

## Class Exercise
1. Classify variables by measurement level
2. Design appropriate data collection strategies for research scenarios
3. Calculate measures of central tendency and dispersion for a dataset
4. Identify outliers using various methods
5. Transform skewed data to approximate normal distribution

## Common Visualization Techniques

### Histograms and Frequency Distributions

**Purpose**: Show distribution of numeric data by dividing into bins and counting observations.

**Key Features**:
- X-axis: Bins/intervals of the variable
- Y-axis: Frequency or relative frequency (percentage)
- No gaps between bars (unlike bar charts)

**Creating a Histogram**:
1. Determine appropriate number of bins
   - Rule of thumb: √n (square root of sample size)
   - Sturges' Rule: 1 + 3.322 × log₁₀(n)
   - Software often has intelligent defaults
2. Count observations in each bin
3. Plot as contiguous bars

**Interpretation**:
- Shape (symmetric, skewed, bimodal)
- Center (where most data falls)
- Spread (how wide the distribution is)
- Outliers (unusually high or low values)

#### Detailed Example: Employee Salary Distribution

A company's HR department wants to analyze the salary distribution of its 120 employees to inform compensation policy decisions.

**Raw Data** (partial sample of annual salaries in thousands):
```
$42K, $55K, $38K, $97K, $62K, $48K, $75K, $45K, $51K, $69K, $82K, $59K, ...
```

**Histogram Creation Process**:

1. **Determine number of bins**:
   - Using square root rule: √120 ≈ 11 bins
   - Round to 10 bins for easier interpretation

2. **Determine bin width**:
   - Range: $112K - $38K = $74K
   - Bin width: $74K ÷ 10 = $7.4K (round to $7.5K for simplicity)

3. **Create bins and count frequencies**:
   | Salary Range | Frequency | Percentage |
   |--------------|-----------|------------|
   | $35K-$42.5K  | 12        | 10%        |
   | $42.5K-$50K  | 23        | 19%        |
   | $50K-$57.5K  | 28        | 23%        |
   | $57.5K-$65K  | 20        | 17%        |
   | $65K-$72.5K  | 14        | 12%        |
   | $72.5K-$80K  | 10        | 8%         |
   | $80K-$87.5K  | 6         | 5%         |
   | $87.5K-$95K  | 3         | 3%         |
   | $95K-$102.5K | 2         | 2%         |
   | $102.5K-$110K| 1         | 1%         |
   | $110K-$117.5K| 1         | 1%         |

4. **Create the histogram visualization**:
   ![Histogram illustration showing frequency on y-axis and salary ranges on x-axis]

**Interpretation of Results**:

1. **Shape**:
   - Right-skewed (positively skewed) distribution
   - Most employees earn in the lower-to-middle salary ranges
   - A long "tail" extends to the right with fewer employees at higher salaries

2. **Central Tendency**:
   - Mode: $50K-$57.5K range (contains most employees)
   - Median: Approximately $58K (middle value)
   - Mean: Approximately $62K (pulled higher by the right skew)

3. **Spread**:
   - Range: $38K to $112K ($74K difference)
   - Most salaries (69%) fall between $42.5K and $72.5K
   - Few employees (7%) earn above $87.5K

4. **Business Insights**:
   - The company has a typical corporate pyramid structure
   - The right skew suggests a small number of high-paying positions
   - The concentration in the $50K-$57.5K range might represent a common role or level
   - HR might consider whether the gap between highest and lowest earners aligns with company values

**Different Bin Choices**:
Changing to 6 wider bins would show:
   | Salary Range | Frequency | 
   |--------------|-----------|
   | $35K-$48K    | 29        |
   | $48K-$61K    | 41        |
   | $61K-$74K    | 26        |
   | $74K-$87K    | 15        |
   | $87K-$100K   | 6         |
   | $100K-$113K  | 3         |

This would make the distribution appear more symmetric by hiding some of the detailed variations, demonstrating how bin choice can influence the visual interpretation.

**Examples of Other Applications**:
- Student test scores (to identify performance patterns)
- Heights of individuals (to design products for target populations)
- Daily temperature readings (to analyze climate patterns)
- Customer purchase amounts (to understand spending behavior)
- Wait times for service (to identify efficiency opportunities)

### Box Plots (Box-and-Whisker Plots)

**Purpose**: Display distribution summary based on five-number summary.

**Key Components**:
- Median (center line)
- First quartile Q1 (bottom of box)
- Third quartile Q3 (top of box)
- Whiskers (typically extend to min/max within 1.5 × IQR)
- Outliers (individual points beyond whiskers)

**Interpretation**:
- Center (median)
- Spread (IQR = box height)
- Skewness (relative position of median within box)
- Outliers (points beyond whiskers)
- Range (distance from lowest to highest point)

**Advantages**:
- Compact representation of distribution
- Easy comparison across groups
- Shows outliers explicitly
- Works well for skewed data

**Examples**:
- Comparing salaries across departments

- Advertising expense vs. sales

### Bar Charts

**Purpose**: Compare values across categories.

**Key Features**:
- Clear category labels
- Consistent width bars
- Space between bars
- Value axis typically starts at zero

**Variations**:
- Grouped/clustered (multiple categories)
- Stacked (showing components)
- Horizontal (for long category names)

**Best Practices**:
- Order categories meaningfully (not alphabetically)
- Use colors consistently
- Label directly if possible
- Consider a horizontal orientation for many categories

**Examples**:
- Sales by region
- Survey responses by category
- Comparison of methods/techniques

### Line Charts

**Purpose**: Show trends over time or continuous variable.

**Key Features**:
- X-axis: Typically time or ordered categories
- Y-axis: Measured value
- Connected points showing trend

**Enhancements**:
- Multiple lines for comparison
- Area shading below line

**Best Practices**:
- Use consistent intervals on x-axis
- Consider starting y-axis at zero
- Limit number of lines (3-5 maximum)
- Use distinctive colors/patterns

**Examples**:
- Stock price over time
- Temperature trends
- Growth rates

### Pie Charts

**Purpose**: Show composition or part-to-whole relationships.

**Key Features**:
- Circle divided into segments
- Each segment represents a proportion of the whole
- Total equals 100%

**Limitations**:
- Difficult to compare segment sizes
- Should be used for 6 or fewer categories
- Cannot show changes over time effectively

**Best Practices**:
- Start at 12 o'clock position with largest segment
- Proceed clockwise
- Label directly when possible
- Consider a bar chart alternative

**Examples**:
- Budget allocation
- Market share
- Survey response breakdown (limited categories)

### Heat Maps

**Purpose**: Show patterns in 2D data using color intensity.

**Key Features**:
- X and Y axes define a grid
- Color represents value at each grid position
- Color scale shows mapping of values to colors

**Applications**:
- Correlation matrices
- Geographic data
- Time patterns (day vs. hour)
- Performance metrics across categories

**Best Practices**:
- Use appropriate color scale
- Include clear legend
- Order rows/columns meaningfully
- Consider annotations for key values

## Advanced Visualization Techniques

### Small Multiples
Multiple versions of the same chart type with different data subsets, allowing for easy comparison.

### Interactive Visualizations
- Tooltips for additional information
- Zooming and panning
- Filtering and highlighting
- Animation to show changes
- Linked views across multiple charts

### Geographic Visualizations
- Choropleth maps (colored regions)
- Point maps (markers at locations)
- Heat maps (density of occurrences)
- Flow maps (movement between locations)

## Common Visualization Pitfalls

### 1. Truncated Axes
- Starting value axis at non-zero value
- Can exaggerate differences
- Creates misleading impression of magnitude

### 2. Poor Color Choices
- Not colorblind-friendly
- Too many colors
- Colors with unintended associations
- Low contrast

### 3. 3D Effects
- Distort perception of values
- Add unnecessary complexity
- Make accurate reading difficult

### 4. Overplotting
- Too many data points obscuring patterns
- Solution: transparency, jittering, sampling

### 5. Chartjunk
- Excessive grid lines
- Unnecessary decorations
- 3D effects
- Distracting elements

### 6. Misleading Comparisons
- Comparing incomparable units
- Not accounting for inflation/population in time series
- Cherry-picking time periods

## Best Practices for Effective Visualization

### 1. Know Your Audience
- Consider their technical knowledge
- Focus on what's relevant to them
- Adjust complexity accordingly

### 2. Choose Appropriate Chart Types
- Match to data type and analytical goal
- Keep it simple when possible
- Don't force novel chart types

### 3. Focus on the Data
- High data-to-ink ratio
- Remove unnecessary elements
